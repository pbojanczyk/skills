description: Smart coding skill that routes tasks by complexity. Simple tasks (<60 lines, single file) execute directly via OpenClaw agent tools. Medium/complex tasks spawn Claude Code via ACP with full project context, coding standards, and historical decisions from agent memory. Use when user asks to write code, fix bugs, build features, refactor, review PRs, deploy, or any software engineering task. Combines OpenClaw long-term memory with Claude Code deep coding ability.

# Coding Lead

> **Priority note:** This skill supersedes any inline coding rules in agent SOUL.md files. If the agent's SOUL.md contains a Coding Behavior section, skip it when this skill is loaded.

Route coding tasks by complexity: simple = do it yourself, complex = spawn Claude Code with full context.

## System Impact

- **Simple tasks**: uses read/write/edit/exec tools to modify project files directly
- **Medium/Complex tasks**: spawns Claude Code via `sessions_spawn(runtime: "acp")` which creates a subprocess with file system access to the specified project directory
- **Memory writes**: logs decisions and changes to agent memory files after each task
- **No credentials required**: uses whatever model providers are already configured
- **ACP requirement**: Claude Code (or compatible coding agent) must be available as an ACP harness for medium/complex tasks. Simple tasks work without ACP.

## Why This Exists

OpenClaw agents have memory but limited coding depth. Claude Code has deep coding ability but no memory across sessions. This skill bridges the gap: the agent acts as engineering manager with persistent context, Claude Code acts as the expert coder.

## Tech Stack Preferences (New Projects)

When starting a new project, propose tech stack based on these preferences and get confirmation before coding:

| Layer | Preferred | Fallback |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Backend | PHP (Laravel or ThinkPHP) | Python |
| Frontend | Vue.js | React |
| Mobile | Flutter | UniApp-X |
| CSS | Tailwind CSS | - |
| Database | MySQL | PostgreSQL |

- **Existing projects**: follow their current stack, never migrate without explicit approval
- **New projects**: propose stack in the PLAN phase, wait for confirmation
- Include tech stack choice in the Claude Code prompt so it uses the right framework

## Model Routing (Multi-Model Setup)

When multiple coding agents/models are available, route tasks by strength:

| Task Type | Best Model | Why |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Backend logic, complex bugs, multi-file refactors | Strongest reasoning model (e.g., Claude Opus, Codex) | Needs deep cross-file reasoning |
| Frontend, quick fixes, simple features | Fast model (e.g., Claude Sonnet, GPT-4o) | Speed matters more than depth |
| UI/UX design mockups | Vision-capable model (e.g., Gemini) | Design sense + visual understanding |
| Code review | Different model than the one that wrote the code | Avoids same-bias blind spots |

### Current Setup
If only one coding agent (e.g., Claude Code) is available, skip model routing — use it for everything. This table is a reference for when you add more models.

### How to Route
When spawning, choose the model via the `model` parameter if supported:
```
sessions_spawn(runtime: "acp", task: <prompt>, cwd: <dir>, model: "claude-opus-4-6")
```

Record which model worked best for each task type in the Prompt Pattern Library.

## Task Classification

Assess every coding request before executing:

| Level | Criteria | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Simple** | Single file, clear requirement, <60 lines changed | Execute directly with read/write/edit/exec tools |
| **Medium** | 2-5 files, needs investigation, clear scope | Spawn Claude Code with context |
| **Complex** | Architecture change, multi-module, high uncertainty | Plan first, then spawn Claude Code |

When in doubt, go one level up.

## Simple Tasks: Direct Execution

Use agent tools: read, write, edit, exec.

Before coding:
1. Read the target file(s)
2. Check for coding standards (look for tech-standards.md, CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, or similar in the project or shared knowledge)
3. Search memory for related past decisions

After coding:
4. Self-check: does it follow standards?
5. Log the change in daily memory file

Examples: config edits, small bug fixes, adding a field, renaming, formatting.

## Medium/Complex Tasks: Spawn Claude Code

### Step 1: Gather Context (agent does this)

Before spawning, collect from available sources:
1. **Project info**: read CLAUDE.md, README, or package.json/composer.json
2. **Coding standards**: check for tech-standards.md (shared knowledge), CLAUDE.md (project), .cursorrules, or equivalent
3. **Past decisions**: search MEMORY.md and daily memory for related work
4. **Task context**: inbox messages, kanban items, product docs if applicable
5. **Known pitfalls**: anything from memory about this codebase

### Step 2: Build the Prompt

Structure for Claude Code:

```
## Project
- Path: [project directory]
- Tech stack: [from docs or memory]
- Key architecture notes: [from CLAUDE.md or memory]

## Coding Standards (mandatory)
[Paste or summarize from whatever standards file exists]
- [Key rule 1]
- [Key rule 2]
- [Project-specific rules]

## Historical Context
[From agent memory -- skip if no relevant history]
- [Past decision 1]
- [Known pitfall]
- [Related prior work]

## Task
[Clear description]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
- [ ] Existing tests pass
- [ ] No unrelated changes
- [ ] Cleaned up: no debug logs, unused imports, temp files
- [ ] If UI changed: screenshots/descriptions of visual changes included
```

### Step 3: Spawn

Medium tasks: `sessions_spawn(runtime: "acp", task: <prompt>, cwd: <project dir>, mode: "run")`
Complex tasks: `sessions_spawn(runtime: "acp", task: <prompt>, cwd: <project dir>, mode: "session")`

Session mode allows follow-up via sessions_send if needed.

### Step 4: Review Output

When Claude Code completes:
1. Check acceptance criteria
2. Verify no unrelated changes
3. Run tests if available
4. If not satisfied, send follow-up via sessions_send

### Step 5: Record to Memory

Update daily memory file with:
- What was done and why
- Key decisions made
- Pitfalls encountered
- Anything future sessions need to know

This is the agent's key advantage: it remembers everything across sessions.

## Complex Task Flow: RESEARCH > PLAN > EXECUTE > REVIEW

### RESEARCH
Spawn Claude Code in session mode to investigate only (no changes):
- List files that need changes
- Identify dependencies and call chains
- Find reusable existing code
- Flag risks

### PLAN
Review findings. Present options if multiple approaches exist. Get confirmation before proceeding.

### EXECUTE
Spawn Claude Code with confirmed plan + full context. Break into sub-tasks if needed.

### REVIEW
Verify output. Run tests. Update memory with decisions and lessons.


## Coding Roles (Complex Tasks Only)

For complex tasks involving multiple layers (architecture + frontend + backend + review), spawn separate Claude Code sessions with role-specific prompts. This gives each phase focused expertise without adding permanent agents.

### When to Use Roles
- **Simple/Medium tasks**: do NOT use roles. One spawn, one prompt, done.
- **Complex tasks (multi-layer)**: use roles when the task spans architecture design, frontend, backend, and/or needs independent review.

### Available Roles

| Role | When to Use | Prompt Prefix |
|------|------------|---------------|
| **Architect** | System design, DB schema, API contracts, tech decisions | "You are a senior software architect. Design scalable, maintainable systems. Output: design doc with file structure, DB schema, API contracts, and implementation notes." |
| **Frontend** | UI components, pages, responsive design, state management | "You are a frontend specialist. Write clean, accessible, performant UI code. Follow the project's frontend patterns." |
| **Backend** | API endpoints, business logic, data layer, integrations | "You are a backend specialist. Write secure, efficient server-side code. Follow the project's backend patterns." |
| **Reviewer** | Code review after implementation | "You are a senior code reviewer. Review for: logic errors, security issues, performance problems, style violations. Be specific, cite line numbers." |
| **QA** | Test writing, edge case analysis | "You are an independent QA engineer. You have NOT seen the implementation code. Based on the requirements and interface definitions provided, write thorough tests covering: happy paths, edge cases, error paths, boundary conditions, and concurrency scenarios." |

### Complex Task Flow with Roles

```
1. RESEARCH (agent reads code, searches memory)
2. PLAN (agent designs approach, gets confirmation)
3. ARCHITECT (spawn) -- if task needs design decisions
   -> output: design doc, schema, API contracts
4. IMPLEMENT (spawn, can be parallel)
   -> Frontend session (if UI involved)
   -> Backend session (if API/logic involved)
   -> Or single fullstack session for smaller scope
5. REVIEW (spawn) -- independent reviewer session
   -> input: diff of all changes
   -> output: issues found, suggestions
6. QA (spawn) -- independent test writing session (see QA Isolation Rule below)
   -> input: requirements doc + interface definitions only (NOT implementation code)
   -> output: test files
7. FIX (spawn or sessions_send) -- address review + QA findings
8. RECORD (agent logs to memory)
```

Not every step is needed. Skip what doesn't apply:
- No UI? Skip frontend.
- Simple backend change? Skip architect + reviewer.
- One-layer change? Single spawn, no roles.

### Role Prompt Template

Prepend the role prefix to the standard prompt structure:

```
[Role prefix from table above]

## Project
- Path: [project dir]
- Stack: [from docs]
...rest of standard prompt...
```

### Parallel Spawning with Roles

Frontend and backend can run in parallel when they don't depend on each other:

```
# These can run simultaneously
Session 1: Frontend role -> "Build the FavoriteButton component..."
Session 2: Backend role -> "Build the favorites API endpoint..."

# This must wait for both to finish
Session 3: Reviewer role -> "Review all changes in [files from session 1 + 2]..."
```



## QA Isolation Rule

> **Critical**: QA sessions must be isolated from implementation to avoid "testing your own homework."

When spawning a QA session:

1. **DO NOT include implementation code** in the QA prompt
2. **DO include**: requirements/task description, interface definitions (function signatures, API contracts, DB schema), acceptance criteria
3. **Spawn as a separate session** — never in the same session that wrote the code
4. **QA prompt structure**:

```
You are an independent QA engineer. You have NOT seen the implementation.

## What to Test
[Requirements / user story / acceptance criteria]

## Interfaces
[Function signatures, API endpoints, DB schema — NO implementation details]

## Project Test Setup
[Test framework, how to run tests, existing test patterns]

## Write Tests For
- Happy paths (normal usage)
- Edge cases (empty input, max values, unicode, special chars)
- Error paths (invalid input, network failure, timeout)
- Boundary conditions (off-by-one, pagination limits, rate limits)
- Business logic edges (concurrent access, partial failure, state transitions)

Do NOT assume implementation details. Test the contract, not the code.
```

5. After QA tests are written, run them against the implementation
6. Failures may indicate **real bugs** (good!) or **spec misunderstandings** (clarify with user)

### Why This Matters
When AI writes code and then writes tests for that code in the same session, the tests mirror the implementation — including its bugs. Isolation forces tests to come from "what should happen" rather than "what does happen."

## Claude Code Tool Tips

When building prompts for Claude Code, remind it to use its specialized tools:
- LSP (goToDefinition, findReferences) for code structure
- Grep/Glob for finding files and patterns
- mcp__context7 for library documentation
- mcp__mcp-deepwiki for open-source project docs

These are Claude Code tools, not OpenClaw tools. Only include in spawned prompts.

## Memory Integration Patterns

### Before spawning
Search memory for related past work. Include findings as "Historical Context" in the prompt.

### After completion
Write detailed record: files changed, decisions made, pitfalls, test results.

### Cross-session continuity
When tasks span multiple sessions:
1. End of session: write detailed status to memory
2. Next session: read memory, reconstruct context
3. Spawn Claude Code with accumulated context

This is the core value: Claude Code gets amnesia every session, the agent does not.


## Progress Updates

When spawning Claude Code for medium/complex tasks, keep the user informed:

1. **On start**: send 1 short message -- what task, which project, estimated complexity
2. **On milestone**: only when something meaningful happens (build done, tests passed, blocked)
3. **On error**: immediately report what went wrong and whether retry is planned
4. **On completion**: summarize what changed, what files were touched, test results

Do NOT poll silently. Do NOT go quiet for long periods. The user should never wonder "is it still running?"

## Auto-Notify on Completion

When spawning Claude Code, append a notification command to the end of the prompt so the agent announces completion automatically:

```
... your task description here.

When completely finished, run this command to notify:
openclaw system event --text "Done: [brief summary of what was built/changed]" --mode now
```

This triggers an immediate notification instead of waiting for the next poll cycle.

## Workdir Isolation

Always specify `cwd` when spawning to keep the coding agent focused:

- Set `cwd` to the **project directory**, not the agent workspace
- This prevents the coding agent from reading team management files (SOUL.md, inboxes, etc.)
- If the project path is unknown, ask the user before spawning

```
sessions_spawn(runtime: "acp", task: <prompt>, cwd: "/path/to/project", mode: "run")
```

## Parallel Tasks

Independent coding tasks can run in parallel:

- Spawn multiple ACP sessions, each with its own task and project directory
- Track via `sessions_list` or `subagents(action: "list")`
- Each session gets its own context -- no interference
- After all complete, review outputs and record to memory

Example: fix 3 independent bugs simultaneously, each in its own session.

Limit: be mindful of API rate limits and system resources. 2-3 parallel sessions is usually safe.

## Task Registry

Track all active coding tasks in a structured JSON file for visibility and automation.

### File: `<project>/.openclaw/active-tasks.json`

When spawning a Claude Code session for medium/complex tasks, register it:

```json
{
  "id": "feat-custom-templates",
  "task": "Custom email templates for agency customer",
  "agent": "claude-code",
  "branch": "feat/custom-templates",
  "cwd": "/path/to/project",
  "sessionKey": "acp:run:abc123",
  "status": "running",
  "startedAt": 1740268800000,
  "complexity": "medium"
}
```

Update on completion:

```json
{
  "status": "done",
  "completedAt": 1740275400000,
  "filesChanged": ["src/templates/engine.ts", "src/api/templates.ts"],
  "checks": {
    "lintPassed": true,
    "testsPassed": true,
    "reviewPassed": true
  },
  "note": "All checks passed. 2 files changed."
}
```

Update on failure:

```json
{
  "status": "failed",
  "failedAt": 1740275400000,
  "attempt": 2,
  "failReason": "Type error in template engine, missing generic constraint"
}
```

### Rules
- Create `<project>/.openclaw/` directory if it doesn't exist
- One entry per task, keyed by `id`
- Agent reads this file before spawning to avoid duplicate work on the same feature
- Clean up completed/failed entries older than 7 days
- This is for the agent's own tracking — not committed to git (add `.openclaw/` to `.gitignore`)




## Review by Complexity

Not every task needs a full review. Match review effort to task complexity:

**Simple (agent did it directly)**: no formal review. If it works, it works.

**Medium (Claude Code)**: quick check only:
- Did Claude Code report success?
- Did tests pass (if run)?
- Skim the output for obvious errors
- Done. Move on.

**Complex (Claude Code, multi-file/architecture)**: full checklist:
- [ ] Logic: edge cases, null checks, error paths
- [ ] Security: injection, auth bypass, data exposure
- [ ] Performance: N+1 queries, unnecessary loops, missing indexes
- [ ] Style: follows tech-standards, consistent naming
- [ ] Tests: existing tests pass, new logic has coverage

If any checklist item fails, send follow-up via sessions_send to fix it (counts toward the 3 retry limit).

## Definition of Done

Every task must meet these criteria before being marked complete. Match the checklist to complexity:

### Simple Tasks (agent did directly)
- [ ] Code change works as intended
- [ ] No syntax errors
- [ ] Logged in daily memory

### Medium Tasks (Claude Code)
- [ ] Claude Code reported success
- [ ] Linter passed (if available)
- [ ] Existing tests pass
- [ ] No unrelated file changes
- [ ] Task registry updated to "done"
- [ ] Logged in daily memory

### Complex Tasks (Claude Code, multi-file)
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Linter passed
- [ ] All tests pass (existing + new)
- [ ] Code review passed (Reviewer role or manual)
- [ ] QA tests written and passing (if applicable)
- [ ] **UI changes: screenshots included** in completion summary
- [ ] No unrelated file changes
- [ ] No debug logs, unused imports, temp files
- [ ] Task registry updated to "done" with filesChanged list
- [ ] Logged in daily memory with decisions and lessons

### UI Screenshot Rule
If a task changes any visible UI (pages, components, modals, emails), the completion report **must include screenshots**. Append this to the Claude Code prompt:

```
If this task changes any visible UI:
1. After completing the code changes, take a screenshot or describe the visual result
2. List all visual changes in your final output with before/after descriptions
3. If a dev server is available, run it and capture the output
```

This saves massive review time — the reviewer can see what changed without running the app.


## Auto-Check in Prompts

When building prompts for Claude Code, always append this block at the end:

```
Before finishing:
1. If a linter is available (npm run lint / php artisan lint / etc.), run it and fix issues
2. If tests exist (npm test / php artisan test / pytest / etc.), run them and ensure they pass
3. Include the check results in your final output
```

This costs zero extra tokens -- Claude Code runs the commands as part of its normal execution. Catches issues before they reach the review step.

## Smart Retry (max 3 attempts)

When a spawned Claude Code session fails, do NOT re-run with the same prompt. Instead:

1. **Analyze the failure**: read the session output, identify root cause
   - Context insufficient? -> narrow scope: "focus only on these 3 files"
   - Wrong direction? -> clarify: "the requirement is X, not Y"
   - Missing info? -> add: include the missing type definitions, config, or docs
   - Environment issue? -> fix the environment first, then retry
2. **Rewrite the prompt**: adjust based on analysis, add constraints or context
3. **Retry**: spawn a new session with the improved prompt
4. **Max 3 attempts**: if still failing after 3 tries, stop and report to the user with:
   - What was attempted
   - What failed each time
   - Your analysis of why
   - Suggested next steps (may need human intervention)

Never blindly retry. Each attempt should be meaningfully different from the last.

## Prompt Pattern Library

After each successful coding task, record what worked in memory:

```
## Prompt Pattern: [task type]
- What worked: [prompt structure that succeeded]
- Key ingredients: [what context was essential]
- Pitfalls: [what caused failures before success]
- Example: [brief prompt snippet]
```

Over time, this builds a library of proven patterns. Before spawning Claude Code, search memory for similar past tasks and reuse successful prompt structures.

Examples of patterns worth recording:
- "Billing features need full DB schema context upfront"
- "Refactors work better with explicit file list + dependency graph"
- "API endpoints need existing route patterns as reference"
- "Always include test file paths for test-related tasks"

This is cumulative knowledge that makes every future task faster and more reliable.

## Safety Rules

- **Never spawn coding tasks in ~/.openclaw/ or the agent workspace directory** -- coding agents may read/modify config files, soul docs, or memory files
- **Never let coding agents modify files outside the specified project directory** without explicit approval
- **Always review output before committing** -- especially for complex tasks
- **Kill runaway sessions** -- if a session runs past timeout or produces nonsensical output, kill it and report
