# Agent Discord

A TypeScript CLI tool that enables AI agents and humans to interact with Discord servers through a simple command interface. Features seamless token extraction from the Discord desktop app and multi-server support.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Get server snapshot (credentials are extracted automatically)
agent-discord snapshot

# Send a message
agent-discord message send <channel-id> "Hello from AI agent!"

# List channels
agent-discord channel list
```

## Authentication

Credentials are extracted automatically from the Discord desktop app on first use. No manual setup required — just run any command and authentication happens silently in the background.

On macOS, the system may prompt for your Keychain password the first time (required to decrypt Discord's stored token). This is a one-time prompt.

### Multi-Server Support

```bash
# List all available servers
agent-discord server list

# Switch to a different server
agent-discord server switch <server-id>

# Show current server
agent-discord server current

# Check auth status
agent-discord auth status
```

## Commands

### Auth Commands

```bash
# Extract token from Discord desktop app (usually automatic)
agent-discord auth extract
agent-discord auth extract --debug

agent-discord auth status

# Logout from Discord
agent-discord auth logout
```

### Message Commands

# Full snapshot
agent-discord snapshot

# Filtered snapshots
agent-discord snapshot --channels-only
agent-discord snapshot --users-only

# Limit messages per channel
agent-discord snapshot --limit 10
```

Returns JSON with:
- Server metadata (id, name)
- Channels (id, name, type, topic)
- Recent messages (id, content, author, timestamp)
- Members (id, username, global_name)

## Output Format

### JSON (Default)

All commands output JSON by default for AI consumption:

```json
{
  "id": "1234567890123456789",
  "content": "Hello world",
  "author": "username",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

### Pretty (Human-Readable)

Use `--pretty` flag for formatted output:

```bash
agent-discord channel list --pretty
```

## Key Differences from Slack

| Feature | Discord | Slack |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Server terminology | Server | Workspace |
| Channel identifiers | Snowflake IDs | Channel name or ID |
| Message identifiers | Snowflake IDs | Timestamps (ts) |
| Threads | Thread ID field | Thread timestamp |
| Mentions | `<@user_id>` | `<@USER_ID>` |

**Important**: Discord uses Snowflake IDs (large numbers like `1234567890123456789`) for all identifiers. You cannot use channel names directly - use `channel list` to find IDs first.

## Common Patterns

See `references/common-patterns.md` for typical AI agent workflows.

## Templates

See `templates/` directory for runnable examples:
- `post-message.sh` - Send messages with error handling
- `monitor-channel.sh` - Monitor channel for new messages
- `server-summary.sh` - Generate server summary

## Error Handling

All commands return consistent error format:

```json
{
  "error": "Not authenticated. Run \"auth extract\" first."
}
```

Common errors:
- `Not authenticated`: No valid token (auto-extraction failed — see Troubleshooting)
- `No current server set`: Run `server switch <id>` first
- `Message not found`: Invalid message ID
- `Unknown Channel`: Invalid channel ID

## Configuration

Credentials stored in: `~/.config/agent-messenger/discord-credentials.json`

Format:
```json
{
  "token": "user_token_here",
  "current_server": "1234567890123456789",
  "servers": {
    "1234567890123456789": {
      "server_id": "1234567890123456789",
      "server_name": "My Server"
    }
  }
}
```

**Security**: File permissions set to 0600 (owner read/write only)

## Limitations

- No real-time events / Gateway connection
- No voice channel support
- No server management (create/delete channels, roles)
- No slash commands
- No webhook support
- Plain text messages only (no embeds in v1)
- User tokens only (no bot tokens)

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication fails or no token found

Credentials are normally extracted automatically. If auto-extraction fails, run it manually with debug output:

```bash
agent-discord auth extract --debug
```

Common causes:
- Discord desktop app is not installed or not logged in
- macOS Keychain access was denied (re-run and approve the prompt)
- Discord is not running and LevelDB files are stale

### `agent-discord: command not found`

**`agent-discord` is NOT the npm package name.** The npm package is `agent-messenger`.

If the package is installed globally, use `agent-discord` directly:

```bash
agent-discord server list
```

If the package is NOT installed, use `bunx agent-messenger discord`:

```bash
bunx agent-messenger discord server list
```

**NEVER run `bunx agent-discord`** — it will fail or install a wrong package since `agent-discord` is not the npm package name.
